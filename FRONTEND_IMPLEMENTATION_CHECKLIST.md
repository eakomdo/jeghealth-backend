## ðŸ”§ Key Implementation Notes

### **Authentication Flow**
```javascript
// Recommended authentication flow
1. User visits protected page
2. Check if access token exists and is valid
3. If token expired, attempt refresh with refresh token
4. If refresh fails, redirect to login
5. After login, redirect back to intended page
6. Store tokens securely (consider httpOnly cookies for production)
```

### **Form Validation Strategy**
```javascript
// Multi-level validation approach
1. Real-time field validation on blur/change
2. Step validation before moving to next step
3. Complete form validation before submission
4. Server-side validation error handling
5. User-friendly error messages
```

### **Error Handling Pattern**
```javascript
// Consistent error handling across the app
try {
  const result = await providerAPI.someMethod();
  if (result.success) {
    // Handle success
  } else {
    // Handle API errors
    setError(result.data || result.error);
  }
} catch (error) {
  // Handle network/unexpected errors
  setError('Network error occurred');
}
```

### **State Management Recommendations**
- Use React Context for global auth state
- Use local state for form management
- Consider Redux/Zustand for complex state needs
- Implement optimistic updates where appropriate
